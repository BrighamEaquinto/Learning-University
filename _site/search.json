    "text": "Biography:\n\nfrom present day west of London and south of Birmingham called Yorkshire which sits just at the tip of the Bristol Channel (https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/scholarsandscientists/william-tyndale.html)\nStudied at the University of Oxford\nBecame an instructor at the University of Cambridge\nHe began his first translation of New Testament in 1523 (from Greek to English) completing it in 1525 (https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Tyndale)\nThe English authorities gave him trouble so he continued his work in Germany in 1524.\nHe completed his first translation of New Testament in July of 1525 (https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/scholarsandscientists/william-tyndale.html)\nHis book The Obedience of a Christian Man (full name The Obedience of a Christen man, and how Christen rulers ought to govern, wherein also (if thou mark diligently) thou shalt find eyes to perceive the crafty convience of all iugglers), is published in 1528\n\n“and is best known for advocating that the king of a country was the head of that country’s church, rather than the pope”. Gerard Wegemer, Thomas More: Portrait of Courage (Scepter, 1998), 131\nbook was officialy banned\nmentioned in the works of Shakespere\n\nArested in 1534 by the Roman Catholic Authorities in Antwerp\nStrangled to death in October 6th, 1536 after being “condemned as a heretic” the month prior. His last words were, “Lord, open the King of England’s eyes!”\n\nEfforts and Contributions:\nTyndale\nWhy They Matter:\nHe translated the New Testament from Greek and Hebrew into English. This laid the ground work for us to enjoy such wide spread access of the Holy Bible. King James of Scotland’s name is the most common bible in circulation. When he commissioned his version of the Bible, almost the entirity of it is made up of Tyndale’s work. This shows that the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ depends on William Tyndale.\nHe gave the people of England access to the Holy Bible. This was common place in other-Europe, but not the case for the people of England, as the church would have it. This fed the fire of the ongoing Reformation which started eight years prior in 1517 when Martin Luther famously nailed his 95 theses on the walls of the church."
