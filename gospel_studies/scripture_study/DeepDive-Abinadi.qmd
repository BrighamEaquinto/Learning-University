- Mosiah 13:29-31 is a perfect Q&A of what was the role of the Law of Moses
- Mosiah 13:33-35 teaches that Moses taught that the resurrection through Christ
- Mosiah 16:13-15 "And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?...Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father."

Mosiah spits fire believing in his commision from the Lord to teach these people of their sins. Now he rests in the hands of The Father having preformed this to his death. At the right hand of The Father.
