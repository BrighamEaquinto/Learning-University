It wouldn’t be put on by one side, they would choose their Pope. To fix this, the cardinals of both parties worked together to gather in Pisa in 1409\n\ninsert picture of leaning tower of pisa\n\nboth parties tried to thwart each other’s claim\nWhat was the result of this concil? It was decided that both of the popes were unworthy to be Pope.\nthis council had the backing of each side as well as the courts in Europe.\nThe next issue the council moved onto was that of simony and other issues in the church.\n\nthis is\n\nAlexander V was elected by the council to be the new pope\nThe council thought this would bring about a productive ending, but it only made the schism worse.\nEurope mostly accepted Alexander to be the pope, but the other two had a big enough base of supporters to cause issues. Also, Alexander died less than a year after becoming Pope.\nJohn XXIII was elected to take his place by the cardinals.\nAnother council gathered at Constance in 1414. There was political termoil and John was sentanced to prison for the rest of his life and Gregory abdicated."

A pope who does not obey the Bible is not to be obeyed.”\nHuss, who had bought an indulgence twenty years earlier, by then had come to the conclusion that only God could grant forgiveness, and that to sell what comes only from God is usurping God’s power\nWas against the sending of Christians to fight in crusaides\n\nExcomunicated more than once\nHe eventually left the public scene and lived in the country side. He continued his writings of the need for reformation whist living there.\nHe was invited to attend a Great Council in Constance from Sigismund. This council was supposed to be a fresh start for the church, so he was ega to attend.\nHe was promised safety there but he was turned on. He was condemed as a heratic and sentance to the slammer.\nIn pleading his cause, he said, “I appeal to Jesus Christ, the only judge who is almighty and completely just. In his hands I place my cause, since he will judge each, not on the basis of false witnesses and erring councils, but on truth and justice.”\nThe Bohemians were indignant after hearing of his myrtr, and almost unanimously repudiated the council. Four hundred and fifty-two noblemen gathered in solemn assembly and announced their agreement with Huss, that an unworthy pope ought not be obeyed. The council countered by ordering that the University of Prague be dissolved\nFour articles came of his death as the Bohemian’s resisted the church.\nThe church rejected them at first but after failed crusaides, they compromised with them. Very sad"

    "text": "Biography:\n\nfrom present day west of London and south of Birmingham called Yorkshire which sits just at the tip of the Bristol Channel (https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/scholarsandscientists/william-tyndale.html)\nStudied at the University of Oxford\nBecame an instructor at the University of Cambridge\nHe began his first translation of New Testament in 1523 (from Greek to English) completing it in 1525 (https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Tyndale)\nThe English authorities gave him trouble so he continued his work in Germany in 1524.\nHe completed his first translation of New Testament in July of 1525 (https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/scholarsandscientists/william-tyndale.html)\nHis book The Obedience of a Christian Man (full name The Obedience of a Christen man, and how Christen rulers ought to govern, wherein also (if thou mark diligently) thou shalt find eyes to perceive the crafty convience of all iugglers), is published in 1528\n\n“and is best known for advocating that the king of a country was the head of that country’s church, rather than the pope”. Gerard Wegemer, Thomas More: Portrait of Courage (Scepter, 1998), 131\nbook was officialy banned\nmentioned in the works of Shakespere\n\nArested in 1534 by the Roman Catholic Authorities in Antwerp\nStrangled to death in October 6th, 1536 after being “condemned as a heretic” the month prior. His last words were, “Lord, open the King of England’s eyes!”\n\nEfforts and Contributions:\n\nThe Engllish can now haev a personal relationship with God\nHe spent grewling hours over the span of two years translating the New Testament from Greek to English.\n\nWhy They Matter:\nHe translated the New Testament from Greek and Hebrew into English. This laid the ground work for us to enjoy such wide spread access of the Holy Bible. King James of Scotland’s name is the most common bible in circulation. When he commissioned his version of the Bible, almost the entirity of it is made up of Tyndale’s work. This shows that the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ depends on William Tyndale.\nHe gave the people of England access to the Holy Bible. This was common place in other-Europe, but not the case for the people of England, as the church would have it. This fed the fire of the ongoing Reformation which started eight years prior in 1517 when Martin Luther famously nailed his 95 theses on the walls of the church.\nSocial order disrupted due to his book and his translation not in the hands of the public"
