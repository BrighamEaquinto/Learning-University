A pope who does not obey the Bible is not to be obeyed.”\nHuss, who had bought an indulgence twenty years earlier, by then had come to the conclusion that only God could grant forgiveness, and that to sell what comes only from God is usurping God’s power\nWas against the sending of Christians to fight in crusaides\n\nExcomunicated more than once\nHe eventually left the public scene and lived in the country side. He continued his writings of the need for reformation whist living there.\nHe was invited to attend a Great Council in Constance from Sigismund. This council was supposed to be a fresh start for the church, so he was ega to attend.\nHe was promised safety there but he was turned on. He was condemed as a heratic and sentance to the slammer.\nIn pleading his cause, he said, “I appeal to Jesus Christ, the only judge who is almighty and completely just. In his hands I place my cause, since he will judge each, not on the basis of false witnesses and erring councils, but on truth and justice.”\nThe Bohemians were indignant after hearing of his myrtr, and almost unanimously repudiated the council. Four hundred and fifty-two noblemen gathered in solemn assembly and announced their agreement with Huss, that an unworthy pope ought not be obeyed. The council countered by ordering that the University of Prague be dissolved\nFour articles came of his death as the Bohemian’s resisted the church.\nThe church rejected them at first but after failed crusaides, they compromised with them.
