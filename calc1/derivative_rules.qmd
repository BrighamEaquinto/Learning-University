__Contant Rule__: Taking the derivative of a constant is $0$

$$
f(x) = c
$$
$$
f'(x) = 0
$$

__Power Rule__: 
$$
f(x) = x^{n}
$$
$$
f'(x) = nx^{n-1}
$$

__Sum & Difference Rules__: Taking the derivative of the sum or difference of $g(x)$ and $f(x)$ is the same as the derivative of $g(x)$ plus or minus the derivative of $f(x)$
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}}(f(x) \pm g(x)) 
\text{ } = \text{ } 
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}}(f(x)) \pm \frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}}(g(x))
$$

__Constant Multiple Rules__: Taking the derivative of a constant times a derivative is the same as the constant multiplied by the derivative
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}}(kf(c)) 
\text{ } = \text{ } 
k\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}}(f(x))
$$

__Product Rule__: Taking the derivative of a function times a function
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}}(f(x)g(x)) 
\text{ } = \text{ } 
f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)
$$

__Quotient Rule__: Taking the derivative of a function divided by a function
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{dx}} \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) 
\text{ } = \text{ } 
\frac{f'(x)g(x)-g'(x)f(x)}{(g(x))^{2}}
$$

__Chain Rule__: to allow us to differentiate composite funtions

$$h(x) = (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$$
$$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$$

__Chain Rule with a Polynomial Function__:
$$
h(x) = (g(x))^{n}
$$
$$
h'(x) = n(g(x))^{n-1}g'(x)
$$

In Latex: 

Double $$ is used for displaying math in the middle of the page in it's own peditsool. I think that is best used for displaying equations. Maybe it can be used to show the steps of multiple equations

It also allows you to view the code output. Single $ is for inline math and I think this should be used most of the time.
