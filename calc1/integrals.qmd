## W08 Homework The Antiderivative

[Homework Assigment](https://www.knewton.com/learn/course/3fcb683e-c7e2-40eb-8221-e47c03f1e6f9/assignment/43023b94-0800-4c73-9823-f67e628f68ef/cover)

This is about going from derivative to back to the function. This is called the antiderivative

$f'(x)$ is the notation for the derivative

$F'(x)$ is the notation for the antiderivative

# Example

Finding Antiderivatives 

Derivative $f'(x) = 1$, then antiderivative $f(x) = x + c$


$f(x) = 2x \quad \Rightarrow \quad F(x) = x^{2}$

# Notation

$F'(x)$ is the process of finding $f(x)$ by starting with a derivative and getting to $f(x)$

### Summation Notation
$$ 
{\sum _{i=1} ^{n} {a_i} }
$$

$a_i$ describes the terms to be added and the $i$ is called the *index*
