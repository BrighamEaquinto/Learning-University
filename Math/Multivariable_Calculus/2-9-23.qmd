Ellipsoid $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} = 1}$ is an egg shape

Ellipitical Paraboloid $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = \frac{z}{c}$ is a egg cut in half horizontally.

Elliptical Cones $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}$

Hyperboloids

Hyperboloid of One Sheet $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}$. This is the surface of the outside, not the whole area. 

Hyperboloid of Two Sheets


- Quadric if at most it' squared
- Complete the square
