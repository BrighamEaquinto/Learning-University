- Dot product gives us a number
  - Determinant method (ijk and the - at the end)
- Cross Product gives a vector
  - Fish method ( don't forget I, j, k )
- Magnitude is the length of a vector, which gives us a number
- Determinant is the length of a matrix, which gives us a number

# Notes

- $a_{T} = \frac{d}{dt}|v|$
- $a_{N} = \sqrt{|a|^{2} - a_{T}^{2}}$
- $\vec{T} = \frac{dr}{ds} = \frac{v}{|v|}$
- $p$ is $r(t) = \cos{(t)} + \sin{(t)} - 2$
- $v$ is $r'(t) = -\sin{(t)} + \cos{(t)}$
- $a$ is $r''(t) = -\cos{(t)} - \sin{(t)}$
- position = length 
- velocity = speed
- Remember common formulas like $\sqrt{ \cos^{2}{(t)} + \sin^{2}{(x)}}$
- Remember cross product!
- Oscillating, normal, and rectifying planes
  - __Oscillating plane__ is a tangent plane to a surface that oscilates back and forth, meaning that as you move along the surface, the tangent plane rotates back and forth, rather than consistently pointing in the same direction.
  - __Normal Plane__ is a tangent plane that is perpendicular to the surface at the point of tangency. Normal planes are used to describe the surface curvature.
  - __Rectifying Plane__ is a tangent plane that intersects the surface along a straight line. Rectifying planes can be thought of as a planes that "unfold" the surface into a flat plane.
  
Computation Formulas for Curves in Space
- Unit tangent vector: $T = \frac{v}{|v|}$
- Principal unit normal vector: $N = \frac{dT/dt}{|dT/dt|}$
- Binormal vector: $B = T \times N$
- Curvature $\kappa = |\frac{dT}{ds}| = \frac{|v \times a|}{|v^{3}|}$
- Torsion: 
- Tangential and normal scalar components of acceleration: 
  - $a = a_{T}T + a_{N}N$
  - $a_{T} = \frac{d}{dt}|v|$
  - $a_{N} = \kappa |v|^{2} = \sqrt{|a|^{2} - a_{T}^{2}}$


- Eliptical paraboloid is what is sounds like. It's a parabola that has elevated. Think of the bottom half of an egg
