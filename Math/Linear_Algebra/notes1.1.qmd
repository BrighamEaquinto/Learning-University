## Section 1.1 Systems of Linear Equations 

</center>

<!-- ### 1/4/23 Week 1 Monday Notes -->

-   Systems of linear equations

-   Is_Linear when Scalar $\times$ variable $=$ variable

-   Linear: $2x_{1}-3x_{2}+5x_{3}=9$

-   Non-Linear: $2\sqrt{x_{1}}+3x_{2}=5$

-   Non-Linear: $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=3$

-   Linear: $ex_{1}+\pi{}x_{2}=\sqrt{2}$

Linear when scalar times variable only. Not variable times variable.

-   Linear. System of equations:

    -   $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=1$
    -   $2x_{1}-3x_{2}+2$

Augmented means it has a solution? An equal sign? an \| ?

### Solving Outcome Possibiblities

Options are either: $0$, $1$, or $\inf{}$

**Existence**: Does there exist a solution?

**Uniqueness**: Is there only one solution?

Remember those rules we learned in Pre-Algebra? Those are coming into play right now. 

- **Replacement**: Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row
    - Example: $R_{2} \rightarrow R_{2}+-2R_{1}$
- **Interchange**: Interchange two rows
- **Scaling**: Multiply all the entries in arow by a nonzero constant
    - Example: $R_{2} \rightarrow \frac{-1}{5}R_{2}$

Vocab:

- Reduced Row Echelon Form


----



Echelon Form
: steplike

Reduced Row Echelon Form
: steplike and only 1's and 0's left of the answers

Theorem 1: Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form
: Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix

Pivot Positions
: in a matrix *A* is a location in *A* that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of *A*. 

Pivot Column
: is a column of *A* that contains leading 1's in the reduced echelon form

Theorem 2: Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
: A linear system is consistent if and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is *not* a pivot column-that is, if and only if an echelon form of the augmented matrix has *no* row of the form $___stuff here___$. 
If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either (i) a unique solution, when there are no free variables, or (ii) infinitely many solutions, when there is at least one free variable.

`~` is used to say the rows are equivalent

- Only way it's inconsistent is if one of the rows is like this 
$\matrix{0 & 0 & 0 &\bigm| & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 &\bigm| & 4}$


Look at this matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & | & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & | & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & | & -2 \end{bmatrix}$. I think this is cool.


- Augmented means the right most column is an answer
- Pivots are used to eliminate variables and get 0's. The left most non zero entry in rref
    - if less rows then columns, will there always be a free variable?: 
    - maximum nuber of pivots is the min of the number of row and columns
    - columns without a pivot are free variables




- coefficient matrix is just
- pivots are non-zeros

## Code Examples

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# See Here
```{python}
#| eval: false
import sympy as sp
from sympy import randMatrix
```


```{python}
#| eval: false
A=sp.Matrix([
    [1,1,1,4],
    [5,1,2,3], 
    [4,-1,6,2]
])
sp.pprint(A)
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
A.rref()
```

## Reviewing 1.1

- In systems of linear equations, "coefficients" are the "scalars" I'm familiar with
- **Consistentness**: 
  - if it has *at least* one soultion for x (at least one set of values for the variables that will satisfy all of the equations in the system)
  - A consistent system of equations has at least one solution.
- **Uniqueness** refers to: a solution to a system of linear equations is said to be "unique" if there is only one set of values for the variables that will satisfy all of the equations in the system.

- Other Thoughts:
  - Side note: AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix. And augmented matrix?
