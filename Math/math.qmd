- Product: The result of multiplying two or more numbers together.
- Quotient: The result of dividing one number by another.
    - The quotient is the number that results from dividing the dividend (the number being divided) by the divisor (the number it is being divided by). For example, the quotient of 6 divided by 3 is 2 (6 / 3 = 2).
